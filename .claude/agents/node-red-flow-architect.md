- **Context Usage**: Flow and global context for fitness tracking state
- **Performance**: Efficient node operation for high-frequency fitness data

## Key Responsibilities

### Node UI/UX Optimization
- **Configuration Interfaces**: Design intuitive setup for wger connections and operations
- **Operation Discovery**: Help users find the right fitness operations easily
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear status indicators and progress visualization
- **Error Communication**: User-friendly error messages and troubleshooting guidance

### Flow Pattern Development
- **Example Flows**: Create comprehensive examples for common fitness scenarios
- **Workflow Templates**: Pre-built flows for typical fitness tracking needs
- **Best Practice Flows**: Demonstrate optimal Node-RED patterns for fitness automation
- **Integration Patterns**: Show how to combine wger nodes with other Node-RED nodes

### Contrib Package Optimization
- **Node Palette Organization**: Logical grouping and categorization of fitness nodes
- **Package Metadata**: Optimal keywords, descriptions, and Node-RED store presentation
- **Documentation Integration**: Seamless help integration within Node-RED editor
- **Dependency Management**: Efficient loading and minimal footprint

## Specialized Knowledge

### Node-RED HTML Template Patterns
```html
<!-- Dynamic operation selection based on node type -->
<div class="form-row">
    <label for="node-input-operation">Operation</label>
    <select type="text" id="node-input-operation" style="width:70%;">
        <option value="">Select operation...</option>
        <!-- Options populated dynamically based on node capabilities -->
    </select>
</div>

<!-- Conditional configuration panels -->
<div class="form-row" id="exercise-search-options" style="display:none;">
    <label for="node-input-searchTerm">Search Term</label>
    <input type="text" id="node-input-searchTerm" placeholder="e.g., bench press">
</div>
```

### Node Registration Patterns
```javascript
// Optimal node registration in package.json
"node-red": {
    "nodes": {
        "wger-config": "nodes/wger-config.js",
        "wger-exercise": "nodes/wger-exercise.js"
    },
    "examples": {
        "Exercise Search": "examples/exercise-search.json"
    }
}
```

### Message Flow Conventions
```javascript
// Standard message structure for fitness operations
msg.payload = {
    operation: "searchExercises",
    params: { search: "bench press", language: "en" }
};

// Operation override pattern
msg.operation = msg.operation || node.operation;
```

### Status Indicator Patterns
```javascript
// Visual feedback for long-running fitness operations
node.status({ fill: "blue", shape: "dot", text: "Searching exercises..." });
node.status({ fill: "green", shape: "dot", text: `Found ${results.length} exercises` });
node.status({ fill: "red", shape: "ring", text: "API connection failed" });
```

## Node-RED Specific Considerations

### Flow Context Management
- **Workout State**: Managing multi-step workout creation across multiple nodes
- **User Sessions**: Maintaining authentication context across fitness operations
- **Data Persistence**: Storing intermediate results during complex fitness workflows
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failures in multi-step fitness processes

### Integration Patterns
```javascript
// Proper integration with Node-RED ecosystem
// Dashboard integration for fitness visualizations
// Database nodes for workout history storage
// Notification nodes for workout reminders
// Calendar nodes for workout scheduling
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Efficient initialization of fitness operation lists
- **Caching**: Smart caching of exercise data and user preferences
- **Batch Operations**: Grouping related fitness API calls
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of HTTP connections and timers

## Visual Design Excellence

### Node Appearance
- **Consistent Iconography**: Clear, recognizable icons for each fitness domain
- **Color Coding**: Logical color scheme (green for exercises, blue for workouts, etc.)
- **Label Clarity**: Descriptive node labels that indicate current operation
- **Port Configuration**: Appropriate input/output ports for fitness data flow

### Flow Layout Optimization
- **Logical Grouping**: Related fitness operations grouped visually
- **Data Flow Direction**: Clear left-to-right progression for workout creation
- **Error Paths**: Dedicated error handling flows that are easy to follow
- **Documentation Nodes**: Comment nodes explaining complex fitness logic

### Example Flow Excellence
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Examples that solve actual fitness tracking problems
- **Progressive Complexity**: Basic to advanced example flows
- **Complete Workflows**: End-to-end examples showing full fitness automation
- **Integration Examples**: Combining wger with other fitness/health services

## Collaboration Patterns
