## üöÄ Breaking Changes

**None** - This release maintains full backward compatibility with v0.1.0.

## üì¶ Installation & Upgrade

### Fresh Installation
```bash
npm install node-red-contrib-wger
```

### Upgrade from v0.1.0
```bash
npm update node-red-contrib-wger
```

### Manual Installation
Use Node-RED's palette manager to search for "node-red-contrib-wger" and install/update.

## üîó Example Usage

### Connect to Self-Hosted Instance
```javascript
// Configuration for self-hosted wger
{
  "apiUrl": "https://my-wger.example.com",
  "authType": "token",
  "token": "your-api-token"
}
```

### Advanced Weight Tracking
```javascript
// Get weight statistics with caching
msg.payload = {
  "dateFrom": "2024-01-01",
  "dateTo": "2024-12-31",
  "groupBy": "week"
};
msg.operation = "getStatistics";
```

### Batch API Operations
```javascript
// Use generic API node for custom operations
msg.payload = {
  "endpoint": "/api/v2/exercise/",
  "method": "GET",
  "params": {
    "muscles": 1,
    "equipment": 7,
    "language": 2
  }
};
```

## üìù Migration Guide

### From v0.1.0
1. **No code changes required** - All existing flows continue to work
2. **Enhanced features available** - Use new example flows as templates
3. **Self-hosted support** - Update configuration if using self-hosted wger
4. **Improved error handling** - Flows will receive better error information

## üêõ Bug Fixes
