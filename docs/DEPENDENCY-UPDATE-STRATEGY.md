# Dependency Update Strategy
## node-red-contrib-wger

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-04  
**Review Cycle**: Quarterly  

---

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Stability First
- Production stability takes precedence over latest features
- Never update dependencies without thorough testing
- Maintain backward compatibility within major versions

### 1.2 Security Always
- Security updates have highest priority
- Apply security patches within 7 days of disclosure
- Run weekly automated security audits

### 1.3 Progressive Enhancement
- Adopt new features gradually
- Test in development before staging
- Monitor community feedback before major updates

---

## 2. Dependency Categories

### Critical Dependencies (Core Functionality)
**Update Frequency**: Conservative  
**Risk Tolerance**: Very Low  

| Package | Role | Update Policy |
|---------|------|---------------|
| axios | HTTP client | Patch: immediate, Minor: 30 days, Major: planned |
| validator | Input validation | Patch: immediate, Minor: 14 days, Major: planned |
| xss | Security sanitization | Security only until replacement planned |

### Development Dependencies (Build & Test)
**Update Frequency**: Moderate  
**Risk Tolerance**: Medium  

| Package | Role | Update Policy |
|---------|------|---------------|
| mocha | Test runner | Patch: weekly, Minor: monthly, Major: quarterly |
| sinon | Test mocking | Patch: weekly, Minor: quarterly, Major: yearly |
| node-red | Development environment | Match target deployment version |

### Node-RED Specific
**Update Frequency**: Synchronized  
**Risk Tolerance**: Low  

- Follow Node-RED release cycle
- Test against multiple Node-RED versions
- Maintain compatibility matrix

## 3. Update Process

### 3.1 Automated Monitoring

#### Weekly Automated Checks
```yaml
# .github/workflows/dependency-check.yml
name: Dependency Audit
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Mondays at 9 AM
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm audit --json > audit-report.json
      - run: npm outdated --json > outdated-report.json
      - name: Process Reports
        run: |
          if [ $(npm audit --audit-level=moderate) ]; then
            echo "Security vulnerabilities found!"
            exit 1
          fi
```

#### Dependabot Configuration
```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
      day: "monday"
      time: "09:00"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    groups:
      development-dependencies:
        patterns:
          - "mocha"
          - "sinon"
          - "should"
        update-types:
          - "minor"
          - "patch"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "automated"
    reviewers:
      - "democratize-technology/maintainers"
```

### 3.2 Manual Review Process

#### Minor Updates (x.N.x)
1. Review new features and deprecations
2. Check compatibility with Node-RED
3. Update relevant documentation
4. Full regression testing
5. Staging deployment (1 week minimum)
6. Production deployment with monitoring

#### Major Updates (N.x.x)
1. Create dedicated update branch
2. Review migration guide
3. Assess breaking changes impact
4. Update code for compatibility
5. Comprehensive testing plan
6. Staging deployment (2 weeks minimum)
7. Coordinate with users for migration
8. Phased production rollout

## 5. Testing Requirements

### Pre-Update Testing
- [ ] Run existing test suite
- [ ] Check Node-RED compatibility
- [ ] Verify example flows work
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Memory usage analysis

### Post-Update Testing
- [ ] Full regression suite
- [ ] Integration with Node-RED
- [ ] Cross-platform verification
- [ ] Documentation accuracy
- [ ] Backward compatibility

### Rollback Criteria
Immediate rollback if:
- Test suite failure >5%
- Performance degradation >10%
- Memory increase >20%

---

## 6. Version Management

### Semantic Versioning
```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

MAJOR: Breaking changes
MINOR: New features (backward compatible)
PATCH: Bug fixes (backward compatible)
```

### Version Constraints
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^1.6.0",      // Minor updates allowed
    "validator": "~13.11.0", // Patch updates only
    "xss": "1.0.15"         // Exact version (security-critical)
  }
}
```

### Lock File Management
- Commit `package-lock.json` always
- Review lock file changes in PRs
- Use `npm ci` in CI/CD
- Regenerate quarterly for cleanup

---

## 7. Communication Strategy

### Internal Communication
- GitHub Issues for tracking updates
- Pull requests for all changes
- Team review for major updates
- Slack/Discord for urgent issues

### External Communication
- Release notes for all versions
- Security advisories when needed
- Migration guides for breaking changes
- Blog posts for major features

### Documentation Updates
- README.md version requirements
- CHANGELOG.md for all changes
- Migration guides when needed
- API documentation updates

---

## 8. Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Security Score**: 0 vulnerabilities target
- **Update Lag**: <30 days for minor versions
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >80%
- **Build Success**: >95% rate
- **Response Time**: Meet SLA for security

### Decision Tree
```
Is it a security fix?
  Yes → Apply immediately
  No → Is it a patch version?
    Yes → Apply within a week
    No → Is it a minor version?
      Yes → Test and apply within month
      No → It's a major version
        → Plan migration
        → Test thoroughly
        → Coordinate release
```
